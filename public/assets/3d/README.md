# 3D Models Required

This directory should contain the following 3D model files for the FluidGlass component:

- `lens.glb` - Lens model for lens mode
- `bar.glb` - Bar model for bar mode  
- `cube.glb` - Cube model for cube mode

## Where to get these models:

You can find example models or create your own GLB files. The component expects these specific file names in this directory.

## Demo Images (Optional)

The component also references demo images in `/assets/demo/`:
- `cs1.webp`
- `cs2.webp`
- `cs3.webp`

These are optional and the component will work without them, but they enhance the visual experience.
